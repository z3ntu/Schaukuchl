# Schaukuchl
This is an Android app for a Restaurant called "Schaukuchl" in Vienna.

## Features
* Display the current menu!
* Offline access (uses data from the last time the app was opened)

## Limitations
Due to the fact, that the app parses the source code (HTML structure) of www.schaukuchl.at/tk/tk.htm, the app can/will break if the original Word Document (from which the HTML is generated), is altered in its structure (eg. add more columns, maybe change Word Version).

## Planned features
* Fallback when the HTML Structure is altered, see [Limitations](#Limitations), to just display the web page.
* If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know!
